# Text-Encrypt
The app encrypts plain text and decrypts encrypted text. App allows to make the
encrypted/decrypted text easily for next sending with any messenger. As a key for encrypt you can use your
own text. We recomend using some text with length from 150 up to 9999 symbols. You have to use the key-text on
language, which you will write your message. For example we offered quote from Wiki (for encrypt messages in
English).
By default we will use this key-text: 
"One of the earliest forms of encryption is symbol
replacement, which was first found in the tomb of Khnumhotep II, who lived in 1900 B.C. Egypt. Symbol
replacement encryption is “non-standard,” which means that the symbols require a cipher or key to
understand. This type of early encryption was used throughout Ancient Greece and Rome for military
purposes."
